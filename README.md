The Shiny application has been developed to enable the creation of circle plots for the B10 cucumber genome. In the first tab, positions on contigs are translated into positions on chromosomes, while in the second tab, a circle plot is created.

Instruction:
The first step is to import a CSV file containing information about the location on the genome (genes, SNPs, etc.).

| contig | start_position | end_position |
|----------|----------|----------|
| ctg1    | 190884     | 190884     |
| ctg1673    | 4422018     | 4422018     |

The next step is to load the downloaded file with chromosome positions into the next tab, where we select the number of files and colors corresponding to HEX values.
